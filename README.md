Jeopardy Project 

Description:

I chose to recreate Jeopardy.

When the player visits my site, he or she will see a huge game board with categories and number values assigned to specific boxes. When the player clicks on a square, a description and three answers worded as questions will appear. The player has three options to choose from, 1 correct answer and two incorrect answers. Once the player chooses the answer, he or she will see an either the word "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT" and a change in color. The color changes to green when correct and red when incorrect. The player continues to choose point values from desired categories until he or she reaches or exceeds 800. Once 800 is reached, the player wins. Otherwise, the player will keep playing until he or she wins.
